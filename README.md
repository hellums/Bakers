# Bakers Percentage
This console app calculates total amount of ingredients needed for different types of bread, based on target weight of dough (vs. volume, for more consistent results). It uses "Baker's Percentage" for each available bread type, where each ingredient is calculated as a percentage of the total Flour. 

Bread models are derived from the base model class and methods, with polymorphic properties for individual ingredient percentages. It is the MVC, interface, and console-based version of my Baker's Percentage Blazor component and API.
