# Bakers Percentage
This is a console app that calculates total amount of ingredients needed for different types of bread, based on target weight of dough (vs. volume, for more consistent results). It uses "Baker's Percentage" for each available bread type, where each ingredient is calculated as a percentage of the total Flour.
